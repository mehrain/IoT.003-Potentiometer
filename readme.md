# IoT 003 - Potentiometer

## Features

The project has the following features:

- Reads the value from a potentiometer.
- Uses an ESP32 microcontroller for analog input and LED control.
- Alternates between four LEDs based on the potentiometer value.
- (Optional) Establishes a Wi-Fi connection to communicate with a remote device.
- (Optional) Provides a web interface to monitor the potentiometer value remotely.

## How to Use

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the Arduino IDE and ESP32 board support.
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the ESP32 board to your computer using a USB cable.
4. Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
5. Enter the Wi-Fi credentials in the code (if using Wi-Fi features).
6. Upload the code to the ESP32 board.
7. Open the serial monitor to view the potentiometer values.
8. Adjust the potentiometer to see the LEDs change based on the value.
